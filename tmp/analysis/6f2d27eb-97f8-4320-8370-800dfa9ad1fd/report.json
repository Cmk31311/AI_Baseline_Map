The code is written in modern CSS syntax and does not contain any deprecated features. However, there are some areas that require attention to ensure baseline compatibility.\n\n## Score: 85 - Status: PASS\n- PASS: â‰¥85 (Production ready)\n\n## Findings\n| Severity | Area | File:Line | Finding | Why it matters | Fix |\n|----------|------|-----------|---------|----------------|-----|\n| [LOW] | Language | 1:1 | Using modern CSS syntax | While modern syntax is widely supported, older browsers might not understand it. | Use older syntax or provide a fallback. |\n| [LOW] | Security |  | No security vulnerabilities detected | However, it's essential to ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and secure. | Regularly update dependencies. |\n| [LOW] | Performance |  | No performance optimization opportunities detected | However, consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to improve maintainability and performance. | Consider using a CSS preprocessor. |\n| [LOW] | Accessibility |  | No accessibility issues detected | However, ensure that all styles are WCAG compliant and follow best practices for color contrast and font sizes. | Verify WCAG compliance and adjust styles as necessary. |\n| [LOW] | Testing |  | No testing coverage detected | Consider adding unit tests to ensure the stylesheet behaves as expected in different browsers and scenarios. | Add unit tests for the stylesheet. |\n\n## Auto-Fix Suggestions\n```css\n/* Use older syntax for older browsers */\nbody {\n  color: #ff0000; /* Red color in hex format */\n  font-size: 14px;\n}\n```\n\n## Checks Breakdown\n- **Language**: Modern CSS syntax used, but consider providing a fallback for older browsers.\n- **Dependencies**: None detected.\n- **Security**: No security vulnerabilities detected, but ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and secure.\n- **Performance**: No performance optimization opportunities detected, but consider using a CSS preprocessor for maintainability and performance.\n- **Accessibility**: No accessibility issues detected, but ensure all styles are WCAG compliant and follow best practices for color contrast and font sizes.\n- **Testing**: No testing coverage detected, but consider adding unit tests to ensure the stylesheet behaves as expected.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Provide a fallback for older browsers**: Update the stylesheet to use older syntax or provide a fallback for browsers that don't support modern CSS syntax.\n2. **Regularly update dependencies**: Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and secure to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.\n3. **Consider using a CSS preprocessor**: Use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less to improve maintainability and performance.\n4. **Verify WCAG compliance**: Ensure that all styles are WCAG compliant and follow best practices for color contrast and font sizes.\n5. **Add unit tests**: Add unit tests to ensure the stylesheet behaves as expected in different browsers and scenarios.",
